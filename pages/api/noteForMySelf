In api folder will not be shown in client server

We write functions here and they only execute when ever
we call them

How to call ==> .../api/ {file name inside api folder}

This functions work just like i did in express js and node js

We can access to req and res in params() and 
we must export the function

// getServerSideProps ==> when you your data changes multiple time in a second
// and changes a lot , or when you need to work with request in backend like authentication
// you can access to backend with passing "context" as a param in () => context.req etc...

// getStaticPaths ==> always use with GSP and return an array wich called "paths" and
// for each query we use one object{} and also return a boolean wich called
// "fallback" and when it is false , we mean if there is anything in url which is not equal
// with the values in paths array then return 404

// getStaticProps ==> when data does not changes a lot and u dont need access in backend
